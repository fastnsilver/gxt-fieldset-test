# See https://github.com/gwt-test-utils/gwt-test-utils/wiki/Unit-testing-basics
# To be able to run client code in a JVM without any servlet container or browser plugin,
# gwt-test-utils requires a META-INF/gwt-test-utils.properties configuration file at the root
# of your project test classpath.
#
# For Versions of gwt-test-utils < 0.40
# Define your GWT module(s) as below.
# Key is used by the getModuleName method in your unit test
# It should be the fully-qualified "." path from the root to your module file
# 	e.g., com.googlecode.gwt.test.sample.Sample.gwt.xml where
# 	com.googlecode.gwt.test.sample is the package where a Sample.gwt.xml is found
# Value is always module-file
#io.fns.GXT.gwt.xml=module-file

# For Versions of gwt-test-utils >= 0.40
# Define your GWT module(s) as below.
# Key is used by the @GwtModule annotation in your unit test
# It should be the fully-qualified "." path from the root to your module file without the gwt.xml extension
# 	e.g., com.googlecode.gwt.test.sample.Sample where
# 	com.googlecode.gwt.test.sample is the package where a Sample.gwt.xml is found
# Value is always gwt-module
io.fns.GXT=gwt-module
